# Class schedule extractor

A website for students at my former college to upload shared schedule, extract their class schedule, and format it for better readability.

The college groups students by degree and the year they started studying, and assigns a specific schedule to each group. Instead of publishing individual schedules, the college releases a single multi-page PDF containing schedules for all ~100 groups.

This website allows students to upload this document, provide their group name, and generate an image/PDF/calendar schedule of their group.

Example:
